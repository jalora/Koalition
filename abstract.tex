Merchants spanning across industries implement loyalty programs to incentivize brand faithfulness among consumers. However, current stand-alone loyalty programs have a flailing success rate retaining customers and fail to take full advantage of network effects that can be gained through cooperative alliances. Though current coalition loyalty programs attempt to solve this issue, they typically conglomerate among large entities in similar industries, alienating smaller businesses that provide complimentary services. These traditional loyalty programs are costly to maintain and the lack of customer participation makes one question if they are even worth while. Koalition addresses the problems found in traditional loyalty programs by leveraging blockchain technology to create an ecosystem that promotes free flow of points for consumers, offer marketing opportunities for merchants, and provide comprehensive data analytics for its users to make better informed decisions.
